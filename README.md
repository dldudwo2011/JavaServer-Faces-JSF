# JavaServer-Faces-JSF
Jakarta EE 9 - JavaServer Faces (JSF)

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Create a JSF web page that uses input fields, command actions, output messages, and a datatable

- How to pass request parameters from one JSF page to another with the <f:param> tag

- How to inject a request parameter into a managed bean property
